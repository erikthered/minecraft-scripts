These are the scripts I'm using for my minecraft server.

# minecraft
This is an init script for the server. I'm keeping it simple and just having it handle start, stop and restart.

# rendermap.sh
Simple script to invoke Overviewer on the desired world folder. After I get a backup script going I'll modify this to use the latest archived copy rather than the live world.
